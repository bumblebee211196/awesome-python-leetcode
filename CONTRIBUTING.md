`awesome-python-leetcode` follows github workflows.

`awesome-python-leetcode` would be very much happy to receive pull requests. Any form of contribution is appreciated even if it is a typo :wink:

Do not be discouraged if the pull request is not accepted, as we have only one developer maintaining the code and he/she must have been busy with some other work.
