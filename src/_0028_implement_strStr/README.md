# [28. Implement strStr()][title]

## Description

Implement `strStr()`.

Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Clarification:**

What should we return when `needle` is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when `needle` is an empty string. This is consistent to C's `strstr()` and Java's `indexOf()`.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: haystack = "aaaaa", needle = "bba"
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input: haystack = "", needle = ""
Output: 0
```
