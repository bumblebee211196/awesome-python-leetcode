# [11. Container With Most Water][title]

## Description

Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
```

**Example 4:**
```text
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
```
