# [763. Partition Labels][title]

<p>You are given a string <code>s</code>. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.</p>
<p>Return <em>a list of integers representing the size of these parts</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
<strong>Output:</strong> [9,7,8]
<strong>Explanation:</strong>
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> s = "eccbbbbdec"
<strong>Output:</strong> [10]
</pre>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 500</code></li>
<li><code>s</code> consists of lowercase English letters.</li>
</ul>
