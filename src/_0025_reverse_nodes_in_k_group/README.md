# [25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group][title]

## Description

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list _k_ at a time and return its modified list.

_k_ is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of _k_ then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

**Example 4:**
```text
Input: head = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```
