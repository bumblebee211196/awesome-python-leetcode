# [2. Add Two Numbers][title]

## Description

You are given two **non-empty** linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: l1 = [2,4,3], l2 = [5,6,4]
Output: [7,0,8]
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input: l1 = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9], l2 = [9,9,9,9]
Output: [8,9,9,9,0,0,0,1]
```
