# [1. Two Sum][title]

## Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target_.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the _same_ element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**
```text
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
```

**Example 2:**
```text
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

**Example 3:**
```text
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```
