# [476. Number Complement][title]

<p>Given a <strong>positive</strong> integer <code>num</code>, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> num = 5
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.
</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> num = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.
</pre>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The given integer <code>num</code> is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.</li>
<li><code>num &gt;= 1</code></li>
<li>You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.</li>
<li>This question is the same as 1009: <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/">https://leetcode.com/problems/complement-of-base-10-integer/</a></li>
</ul>
